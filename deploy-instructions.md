# 🚀 Deployment Instructions with Enhanced Logging

## 📋 What I've Added

I've added comprehensive logging to help debug the product deletion issue:

### 1. **Message Handler Logging** (`incremental-updater/src/handlers/message-handler.js`)
```javascript
case 'ProductDeleted':
  console.log(`🗑️ ProductDeleted case triggered, calling syncProduct with delete action for: ${productId}`);
  const deleteResult = await this.productSyncService.syncProduct(productId, 'delete');
  console.log(`✅ ProductDeleted sync completed for: ${productId}`, deleteResult);
  return deleteResult;
```

### 2. **ProductSyncService Logging** (`incremental-updater/src/services/product-sync-service.js`)
```javascript
async syncProduct(productId, action = 'upsert') {
  console.log(`🔄 ProductSyncService.syncProduct called with: productId=${productId}, action=${action}`);
  
  if (action === 'delete') {
    console.log(`🗑️ Calling VertexService.deleteProduct for product: ${productId}`);
    const result = await this.vertexService.deleteProduct(productId);
    console.log(`✅ VertexService.deleteProduct completed for product: ${productId}`, result);
    return result;
  }
  // ... rest of the method
}
```

### 3. **VertexService Logging** (Already Enhanced)
The VertexService already has detailed logging:
- `🗑️ Starting deletion of product ${productId} from Vertex AI...`
- `🔑 Getting access token for Vertex AI...`
- `🌐 Making DELETE request to: ${url}`
- `📡 Response status: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`

## 🎯 Expected Log Flow

When you receive a `ProductDeleted` event, you should now see:

```
Handling product message: ProductDeleted for product 4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764
🗑️ ProductDeleted case triggered, calling syncProduct with delete action for: 4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764
🔄 ProductSyncService.syncProduct called with: productId=4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764, action=delete
🗑️ Calling VertexService.deleteProduct for product: 4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764
🗑️ Starting deletion of product 4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764 from Vertex AI...
🔧 Vertex AI auth available, proceeding with deletion...
🔑 Getting access token for Vertex AI...
✅ Access token obtained successfully
🌐 Making DELETE request to: https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/...
📡 Response status: 200 OK
✅ Product 4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764 successfully deleted from Vertex AI
✅ VertexService.deleteProduct completed for product: 4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764
✅ ProductDeleted sync completed for: 4d629884-2263-474d-93a3-cf8db1965764
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated code** to your commercetools Connect application
2. **Delete a product** in commercetools to trigger the event
3. **Check the logs** to see exactly where the process fails
4. **Share the logs** with me so I can help identify the exact issue

## 🔍 What to Look For

- **If you see the first few logs but not the Vertex AI logs**: The issue is in VertexService initialization
- **If you see Vertex AI logs but get an error**: The issue is with the Vertex AI API call
- **If you don't see the ProductSyncService logs**: The issue is in the message handler

The enhanced logging will show us exactly where the deletion process is failing! 🎯
